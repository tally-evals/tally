The assistant proactively used retained information to summarize the plan and offer relevant suggestions. There were no significant contradictions. The only minor point that could be seen as slightly less than perfect retention was the assistant's repeated need to clarify restaurant specifics for sourdough bowls, but this was more due to the limitations of the tool than a failure to recall the user's request. The weather information was also correctly recalled when asked a second time. The score reflects excellent retention with very minor areas where explicit confirmation was perhaps slightly more than strictly necessary due to the conversational flow and tool capabilities.",

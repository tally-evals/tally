Many of them specialize in fresh seafood and are very likely to offer delicious clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. Places like Boudin Bakery & Cafe are famous for their sourdough and offer seafood options. You might also want to check out Scoma's or Fog Harbor Fish House, which are well-regarded for their seafood and waterfront views.

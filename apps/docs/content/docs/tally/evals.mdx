description: Defining pass/fail criteria for your agents.

**Evals** are the primary way to define what you want to measure and how you determine if a measurement "passes" or "fails". An Eval combines a **Metric** (or Scorer) with a **Verdict Policy**.

## Types of Evals

Tally provides three specialized Eval types based on the scope of evaluation.

### Single-Turn Evals

Evaluates individual steps in a conversation. Useful for checking immediate responses, tool call accuracy, or safety.

```ts
import { defineSingleTurnEval, thresholdVerdict } from '@tally-evals/tally';

const responseEval = defineSingleTurnEval({
  name: 'Response Relevance',
  metric: relevanceMetric,
  verdict: thresholdVerdict(0.7), // Pass if score >= 0.7
});
```

### Multi-Turn Evals

Evaluates the entire conversation as a whole. Useful for checking goal completion, topic adherence, or overall user satisfaction.

```ts
import { defineMultiTurnEval, thresholdVerdict } from '@tally-evals/tally';

const goalEval = defineMultiTurnEval({
  name: 'Goal Completion',
  metric: goalCompletionMetric,
  verdict: thresholdVerdict(1.0), // Must be perfectly completed
});
```

### Scorer Evals

Combines multiple metrics into a single score using a **Scorer**, then applies a verdict.

```ts
import { defineScorerEval, thresholdVerdict } from '@tally-evals/tally';

const qualityEval = defineScorerEval({
  name: 'Overall Quality',
  inputs: [relevance, completeness, toxicity],
  scorer: qualityScorer,
  verdict: thresholdVerdict(0.8),
});
```

## Verdict Policies

A verdict policy takes the normalized score (0-1) and returns a `pass`, `fail`, or `error` status.

- `thresholdVerdict(val)`: Pass if score >= val.
- `booleanVerdict()`: Pass if score is 1, fail if 0.
- `rangeVerdict(min, max)`: Pass if score is between min and max.
- `customVerdict(fn)`: Implement your own logic.

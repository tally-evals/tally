title: Evals
description: Turning measurements into actionable business decisions.
---

In Tally, **Evals** represent the **Decision Layer**. While Metrics capture data and Scorers normalize it, Evals are what turn those numbers into an actionable signal: **Pass or Fail**.

An Eval is the "Voice of the Business." It defines the threshold of quality that your agent must meet before it is trusted to interact with users or be deployed to production.

## Why Evals Matter

Without Evals, you only have numbers. With Evals, you have a **judgment**.

| Feature | The Value of Evals |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Actionable Signal** | Instead of looking at a relevance score of `0.72` and wondering if it's "good enough," an Eval provides a definitive `Pass` or `Fail` status. |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Evals are designed to be the gatekeepers of your development cycle. You can automatically block a PR if the **Pass Rate** falls below your required threshold. |
| **Policy vs. Measurement** | By separating the *measurement* (Metric) from the *policy* (Verdict), you can change your standards (e.g., making a test stricter) without needing to change your domain logic. |

## The Anatomy of an Eval

Every Eval is composed of two parts:
1.  **The Logic**: A [Metric](/docs/tally/metrics) or a [Scorer](/docs/tally/scorers) that produces a value.
2.  **The Verdict**: A **Verdict Policy** that decides if that value constitutes a "Pass."

## Types of Evals

### 1. Single-Turn Evals
The most granular check. Use these to ensure every single interaction meets a minimum standard of safety or correctness.

```ts
import { defineSingleTurnEval, thresholdVerdict } from '@tally-evals/tally';

// Decision: "Every response must be at least 70% relevant"
const relevanceEval = defineSingleTurnEval({
  name: 'Response Relevance',
  metric: relevanceMetric,
  verdict: thresholdVerdict(0.7),
});
```

### 2. Multi-Turn Evals
The "big picture" check. Use these to evaluate high-level goals that can only be judged by looking at the entire conversation.

```ts
import { defineMultiTurnEval, thresholdVerdict } from '@tally-evals/tally';

// Decision: "The user's goal must be 100% achieved by the end"
const successEval = defineMultiTurnEval({
  name: 'Goal Completion',
  metric: goalCompletionMetric,
  verdict: thresholdVerdict(1.0),
});
```

### 3. Scorer Evals
The weighted decision. Use these when "quality" depends on a balance of several factors (e.g., a mix of relevance, speed, and tone).

```ts
import { defineScorerEval, thresholdVerdict } from '@tally-evals/tally';

// Decision: "The overall weighted quality must be >= 0.8"
const qualityEval = defineScorerEval({
  name: 'Production Quality',
  inputs: [relevance, completeness, toxicity],
  scorer: qualityScorer,
  verdict: thresholdVerdict(0.8),
});
```

## Verdict Policies

A verdict policy is the rule that converts a score (usually 0–1) into a status (`pass`, `fail`, or `error`).

### `thresholdVerdict(threshold)`
Passes if the score is greater than or equal to the threshold. The most common way to set a "quality bar."

```ts
const verdict = thresholdVerdict(0.8);
```

### `booleanVerdict()`
Designed for binary checks. Passes if the value is `1` (or `true`), fails if it is `0` (or `false`).

```ts
const verdict = booleanVerdict();
```

### `rangeVerdict(min, max)`
Passes if the score falls within a specific window. Useful for checking if an agent is staying within a balanced zone (e.g., "neither too brief nor too verbose").

```ts
const verdict = rangeVerdict(0.4, 0.6);
```

### `customVerdict(fn)`
When your business rules are complex. You can use metadata or other context to decide the outcome.

```ts
const verdict = customVerdict((score, ctx) => {
  // If the interaction is marked as "Critical," we require a perfect score.
  if (ctx.target.metadata?.isCritical && score < 1.0) return 'fail';
  return score >= 0.75 ? 'pass' : 'fail';
});
```

## Summary

Use **Evals** to draw a line in the sand. They transform Tally from a measurement tool into a **trust-building engine** for your LLM agents.

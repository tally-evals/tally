title: Scorers
description: Normalizing and combining metrics into unified scores.
---

While **Metrics** focus on capturing raw domain data (which can be numeric, boolean, or ordinal), **Scorers** are responsible for transforming those heterogeneous results into a unified, normalized format—usually a **0–1 Score**.

Scorers act as the "normalization bridge" in Tally, allowing you to combine diverse measurements into high-level concepts like "Overall Quality," "Safety," or "Professionalism."

## Metrics vs. Scorers

The primary difference between a Metric and a Scorer is their **output requirements** and **responsibility**:

| Feature | Metric | Scorer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | Conversation data (Step or History). | Multiple Metric results. |
| **Output Type** | Any (ms, boolean, stars, etc.). | **Always Numeric (normalized 0–1).** |
| **Responsibility** | Domain-specific measurement. | Weighting, normalization, and combination. |
| **Composability** | Atoms of measurement. | Molecules of evaluation. |

## Why Normalize to 0–1?

Normalization is the process of mapping a raw value (like "500ms" or "4 stars") onto a standard 0–1 scale. This is a critical step for two reasons:

1.  **Fair Weighting**: You cannot directly average "500ms" and "true." Normalizing both to a 0–1 scale allows you to apply meaningful weights (e.g., latency is 20% of the score, correctness is 80%).
2.  **Consistent Verdicts**: By enforcing a 0–1 output, you can use standard **Verdict Policies** (like `thresholdVerdict(0.8)`) across any scorer, regardless of which metrics it combines.

## Weighted Average Scorer

The `WeightedAverageScorer` is the most common scorer. It takes a list of input metrics, normalizes each one, and calculates a weighted mean.

```ts
import { createWeightedAverageScorer, defineInput } from '@tally-evals/tally/scorers';
import { createMinMaxNormalizer } from '@tally-evals/tally/normalization';

// 1. Define the Scorer
const qualityScorer = createWeightedAverageScorer({
  name: 'OverallQuality',
  inputs: [
    // Use defineInput to combine metrics with weights and normalizers
    defineInput({ 
      metric: relevanceMetric, 
      weight: 0.6 
    }),
    defineInput({ 
      metric: latencyMetric, 
      weight: 0.4,
      // Map 0-2000ms to 1-0 (inverted: lower is better)
      normalizerOverride: createMinMaxNormalizer({ min: 2000, max: 0, clip: true })
    }),
  ],
});
```

See the full `defineInput()` API reference in [`/docs/tally/reference/scorers`](../reference/scorers.mdx#defineinput) for options and defaults.

## Custom Scorers

For non-linear combinations (e.g., if any toxicity is detected, the entire quality score should be zero), you can define a custom scorer.

### What gets passed to a custom scorer?

`combineScores` receives a **map of normalized scores**, keyed by metric name. The shape is:

```ts
type InputScores = Record<string, Score>;
// In practice, it's strongly typed based on the metrics you pass to `inputs`.
```

Your function must return a **normalized `Score`** (0–1).

```ts
import { defineScorer, defineBaseMetric } from '@tally-evals/tally';
import { defineInput } from '@tally-evals/tally/scorers';

export const safetyPenaltyScorer = defineScorer({
  name: 'SafetyAdjustedQuality',
  output: defineBaseMetric({ name: 'safetyAdjustedQuality', valueType: 'number' }),
  inputs: [
    defineInput({ metric: qualityMetric, weight: 1 }),
    defineInput({ metric: toxicityMetric, weight: 1 })
  ],
  combineScores: (scores) => {
    const quality = scores[qualityMetric.name];
    const toxicity = scores[toxicityMetric.name];

    // Non-linear logic: 
    // If toxicity is high (> 0.2), ignore quality and return 0
    if (toxicity > 0.2) return 0;
    
    return quality;
  }
});
```

## Summary

Use **Metrics** to measure your domain. Use **Scorers** to bring those measurements into Tally's standardized 0–1 evaluation space. Once normalized, these scores can be passed to **Evals** for a final pass/fail decision.

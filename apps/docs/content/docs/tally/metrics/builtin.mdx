Tally comes with a set of pre-built metrics that use LLMs to evaluate responses. These are designed to be used with AI SDK providers.

## Single-Turn Metrics

These metrics evaluate individual steps or turns in a conversation.

| Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `answerRelevance` | How relevant is the response to the user's input? |
| `completeness` | Does the response address all parts of the user's query? |
| `toxicity` | Checks for harmful or offensive content in the response. |
| `toolCallAccuracy` | Validates that the agent called the correct tools with correct params. |

## Multi-Turn Metrics

These metrics evaluate the entire conversation as a whole.

| Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `roleAdherence` | Does the agent maintain its assigned persona throughout? |
| `goalCompletion` | Did the agent successfully achieve the user's goal? |
| `topicAdherence` | Did the agent stay on topic across multiple turns? |

## Usage Example

```ts
import { createAnswerRelevanceMetric } from '@tally-evals/tally/metrics';
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';

const model = google('models/gemini-2.0-flash');
const relevance = createAnswerRelevanceMetric({ provider: model });
```

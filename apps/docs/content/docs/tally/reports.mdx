description: Analyzing and exporting evaluation results.
---

Running `tally.run()` produces an `EvaluationReport`. This report contains comprehensive data about the entire evaluation run.

## Report Structure

An `EvaluationReport` includes:

- `evalSummaries`: Aggregated statistics for each Eval (mean, pass rate, etc.).
- `perTargetResults`: Detailed scores and verdicts for every individual conversation or step.
- `metadata`: Run duration, timestamps, and environment info.

## Exporting Results

### Console Tables

Tally provides a utility to format the report summary as a pretty table for the console.

```ts
import { formatReportAsTables } from '@tally-evals/tally';

const tally = createTally({ ... });
const report = await tally.run();

console.log(formatReportAsTables(report));
```

### JSON Export

For CI/CD or custom dashboards, you can export the entire report as JSON.

```ts
import { reportCodec } from '@tally-evals/core';

const json = reportCodec.encode(report);
await fs.writeFile('report.json', json);
```

## CI Integration

A common pattern is to fail the CI build if the pass rate falls below a certain threshold.

```ts
const report = await tally.run();
const summary = report.evalSummaries.find(s => s.evalName === 'Overall Quality');

if (summary.passRate < 0.95) {
  console.error(`Pass rate too low: ${summary.passRate * 100}%`);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

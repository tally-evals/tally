The `@tally-evals/core` package provides the essential building blocks for the entire Tally ecosystem. It ensures type safety and consistent data structures between conversation generation and evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Shared Types**: Canonical definitions for `Conversation`, `StepTrace`, and `ModelMessage`.
- **Configuration**: A unified way to configure storage and project settings.
- **Storage Adapters**: Pluggable backends for saving evaluation artifacts (Local, S3, Redis).
- **Codecs**: Zod-based serialization for all Tally data formats.
- **Message Utilities**: Helpers for extracting text and tool calls from LLM messages.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @tally-evals/core
```

## Why use Core?

While you primarily interact with `@tally-evals/tally` or `@tally-evals/trajectories`, the `@tally-evals/core` package is where you'll find the type definitions and configuration helpers needed for deeper integration and custom extensions.

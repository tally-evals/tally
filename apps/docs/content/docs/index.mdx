# Welcome to Tally

Tally is a comprehensive TypeScript evaluation framework designed for running model evaluations. It provides a structured approach to testing and measuring model behavior through a clear, intuitive API.

## What is Tally?

Think of Tally as a **testing lab for model behavior**. Each test (Eval or Scenario) runs data through a set of judges (Evaluators), who measure specific qualities (Metrics) and then summarize the results (Aggregators).

In simple terms:

> **Data comes in → Evaluators measure → Aggregators summarize → Reports tell the story.**

## Key Concepts

### 🧩 The Big Picture

- **Conversation** → multi-turn exchanges used to test dialogue or reasoning over time
- **Dataset** → collection of conversations or individual items to evaluate
- **Metric** → defines what to measure (LLM-based or code-based)
- **Eval** → combines a Metric with a Verdict policy (pass/fail criteria)
- **Evaluator** → groups related Evals together with a run policy
- **EvaluationReport** → final output with aggregated summaries and detailed results

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { createTally, createEvaluator } from '@tally-evals/tally'

// Define your evaluation
const evaluator = createEvaluator({
  name: 'Quality Check',
  evals: [/* your evals */]
})

// Run evaluation on your data
const tally = createTally({
  data: myConversations,
  evaluators: [evaluator]
})

const report = await tally.run()
```

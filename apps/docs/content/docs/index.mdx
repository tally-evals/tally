# Welcome to Tally

Tally is a comprehensive TypeScript evaluation framework designed for running model evaluations. It provides a structured approach to testing and measuring model behavior through a clear, intuitive API.

## What is Tally?

Think of Tally as a **testing lab for model behavior**. Each test (Eval or Scenario) runs data through a set of judges (Evaluators), who measure specific qualities (Metrics) and then summarize the results (Aggregators).

In simple terms:

> **Data comes in → Evaluators measure → Aggregators summarize → Reports tell the story.**

## Key Concepts

### 🧩 The Big Picture

- **Dataset** → individual examples like prompts, completions, or structured outputs
- **Conversation** → multi-turn exchanges used to test dialogue or reasoning over time
- **Evaluator** → connects Selector (chooses scope) and Scorer (applies measurement logic)
- **Metric** → defines what kind of signal to record (Boolean, Number, Ordinal/Enum)
- **Aggregator** → combines signals into meaningful summaries
- **EvaluationReport** → final output with detailed and summary results

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { tally } from 'tally'

// Framework implementation coming soon
console.log(tally)
```

# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by Changesets, a resource for managing versioning and changelogs.

Inside this folder, there should be one or more markdown files. These files are called Changesets, and they store information that is used to create a changelog.

Recommended not to commit `.changeset/pre.json` to source-control (unless you want to run pre-releases).
